some event ids may have expired or invalid for instance when I

call the event id above ('92cf7db605a734b10e69eabf56e1eac9')

on the website I get the error below:
{"message":"Event not found. 
The event may have expired or the event id is invalid.",
"error_code":"EVENT_NOT_FOUND","details_url":"https://the-odds-api.com/liveapi/guides/v4/api-error-codes.html#event-not-found"}

when I call the function below the error displayed is object 'resp' not found
the function in the oddsapiR creates an object resp if the variable provided are correct 
but if the values provided in the function variable

are not available in the database the resp object is not created thus the error is produced.
